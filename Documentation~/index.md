# HyperTween

HyperTween is a [tweening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbetweening) framework for Unity Engine, built using [Unity ECS](https://unity.com/ecs). It is designed to be highly performant, simple to use, modular, and compatible with legacy (non-DOTS) Unity systems.

Please see [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) for a guide on how to install the package and quickly understand the basics.

There are a number of principles that guided the development of HyperTween:

* [Fluent API](docs/basic-tween-creation.md#fluent-api)
* [High Performance](docs/performance.md)
* [Tween Reusability](docs/advanced-misc.md#reusing-tweens)
* [Extensibility](docs/extending-outputs.md)
* [Complex Sequencing](docs/basic-tween-sequencing.md)
* [Accurate Timing](docs/advanced-misc.md#sequence-timing-accuracy)
* [Conflict Detection](docs/advanced-misc.md#conflict-detection)
* [Compatible with Managed Components](docs/module-ui.md)

I welcome your feedback on the [issues](https://github.com/david-rzepa/HyperTween/issues) page.
