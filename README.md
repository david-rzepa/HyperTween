# HyperTween

HyperTween is a [tweening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbetweening) framework for Unity Engine, built using [Unity ECS](https://unity.com/ecs). It is designed to be highly performant, simple to use, modular, and compatible with legacy (non-DOTS) Unity systems.

Please see the [documentation](https://david-rzepa.github.io/HyperTween/) for more info.
